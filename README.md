# React Challenge #2
## Manipulating Component CSS

In this challenge you will learn how to dynamically change the styles of a page.

## The Challenge
There is a form on the left side of page with first name and last name input fields.
On the right side, there is a text that says "My Name is Static Fullname"

When text is entered in the first name and last name input fields, and the submit button is clicked, the text on the right side of the page should update to replace "Static Fullname" with the value entered in the input field.

For example, if I enter 'George' in the first name field, and 'Washington' in the last name field then click submit, the right side of the page should display "My Name is George Washington"

You are NOT allowed to change any of the class names or ids.
You can look at the Child component file at **src/components/child/Child.js** but you should NOT modify its contents.

All your work should be in the file **src/components/App/App.js**. Do NOT create or modify other files.

**Hint:** Use the component's **state**.

### Requirments
- Nodejs
- Yarn

To start this challenge run the commands:
```
yarn install

yarn start
```

To test your code via the command line run the command:
```
yarn test
```
If your code does not pass the tests, you *will not* be able to submit your code.


After you finish the challenge, commit and push your changes.

Have fun!
